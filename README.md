Design and implement a solution that solves <b>bandwidth problem</b> as fast as possible.

The bandwidth problem(NP-complete) takes as input a graph G, with n vertices and m edges (ie. pairs of vertices).
The goal is to find a permutation of the vertices on the line which minimizes the maximum length of any
edge.
